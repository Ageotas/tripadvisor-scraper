Get there early for the science lab show and puppet show. I wasn't able to do the planetarium show because you need to be 4yrs old and older to get in. The staff was informative and so friendly. They even taught us how to do a few carnival tricks. I found myself telling the kids to hold on a minute while mommy finishes this...because it was even fun for me. They had something for all ages. The only negative I can think of is the hours need to be longer in the day. We spent 5 hrs there and even though we got to see/do everything, we wanted more time.

Her favourite was the sand pit that allows you to make mountains with beautiful feeling sand. She ran amok, not knowing which direction to go in first.

2 July 2015,"I loved taking my kids here and now that I am a grandparent, I have returned and remember why I liked it so much. The kids can touch, learn and play at their own level. Younger kids can look at the real fish and chickens, go to the puppet show, and play in their area. Older kids and adults can experiment, make things, see how things work and attend science shows or the planetarium. The special areas are always changing. Last time I went it was all about circus attractions, this time it was transport with planes to climb in and feel like flying and airships to manoevre. You can take your own lunch or enjoy the cafe there. It keeps the kids entertained for hours. I bought a years pass which gets unlimited entry and free parking and discounts at the cafe so have been 4 times already. Thoroughly recommended!",5.0,284879313,all day outing for the whole family

17 March 2016,There is so much to do at this museum. It is a fantastic learning environment for children. Some parts are a little dated (the 3-7yr old area) but lots of the displays are fairly new.

9 April 2016,"I have visited Scitech on and off since the 80s and learned a couple of things along the way... Staff are motivated and enthusiastic, exhibits are ever-changing with some good staples, and shows are always engaging. The place caters well for various age groups and would also be fun for adults-only groups during a quiet time (I actually went to a 40th birthday there one evening). School groups can turn the place into a nightmare so pick your times to visit carefully (very early or late in the day is usually good). Saying that, school excursions are run well, with great activities planned for specific age groups. If you visit as a one-off, allow plenty of time to watch the science shows and visit the Planetarium, particularly if you have children above 8 years of age. Though small, Scitech compares quite well to other Science centres around the world. If you live in Perth, purchasing the yearly pass for the family can be great as you can pop in whenever you are near the city and just stay for short bursts (which is probably more beneficial from an educational perspective).If you park in the car park below, Scitech will cover the cost of your parking - just take your ticket to the desk and show them.",4.0,362641648,Pick your time to visit!
