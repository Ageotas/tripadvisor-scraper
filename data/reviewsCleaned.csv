He's now 29 and still likes to go, but now we also take his young cousins, aged 10 and 12. We first took the twelve year old when he was four and the magic has stayed.

31-Dec-11,"It is all that complicated science explained so simply through hands on experience. Displays are always changing so you can go again & again.

26-Jun-12,"The dinosaurs exhibit is fantastic - there are several really life like models including a dinosaur incubating a clutch of hatching eggs. Some really good interactive displays. The planetarium show was good as ever we saw the weather in the solar system having seen the other two shows before (they could do with some new ones). there was a show on we would have gone for had it been noted on the website, which doesn't seem to be updated with all that is happening. Sadly the helicopter flight sim was broken, but kids were happy enough just sitting in the copter. ",5,132802944,Dinosaurs are ace

26-Jul-12,Scitech is a great place for the family or friends. The different shows and unusual things to discover and play are amazing. I love the section when you go through this tunnel and it will count down and it will print your shadow on the screen.

6-Aug-12,We are visiting Perth for a month so the amount of fun our kids had here warranted a second visit. We realized this on the day so could easily upgrade our tickets to a family yearly pass.

17-Aug-12,Scitech has been around for years even when I was younger but the venue is small and as a adult who is not taking a class to a school excursion you might feel a bit ripped of off they change there there's and try to make it seem new but it really is that same low budget place I visited in the early 90s ,2,137439773,small venue not as exiting as they make it seems
20-Aug-12,We went to the planetarium awesome and the dinosaurs in Scitech kids love it,4,137706026,School Outing

1-Sep-12,"We visited Scitech in March this year and had a really enjoyable day out. Our children are 2 and 4 and there was plenty to entertain them both. My 2 year old son loved building a wall, using the wheelbarrows and posting bricks. My daughter saw one of the shows and was really keen to try each of the exhibits. We all loved the lifeboat ball pool and lost my son a few times. The 360 degree bike was a hit with my husband although he came off it feeling a little sick!! We spent a full day there and would thoroughly recommend it as a great day out.",5,138999394,Fun day out for kids and mum and dad
3-Sep-12,"This was the second birthday party we'd been to at Scitech with my 6 year old. There are so many things to see and do, it's always a great half day out for us.

4-Sep-12,the kids said you learn a lot about science and it is fun to go there. They like the dinosaurs and the hand on experience,4,139330998,very imformative

Its fantastic for children and the gift shop is great too. If you have a family, go. If not, pass.",3,146610197,Great for kids... then you go back as an adult

22-Jan-13,Brilliant place for children to learn in a interactive environment. The program changes which is fantastic and children are happy to visit over and over. For parents there is easy parking below the building and light food can be provided. The cost is a little high for struggling families which is not fare. Scitech should be for everyone to learn. Science and Maths are the weakest subjects in the classroom and anything that can help students become engaged and wanting to learn more about science - well and good. Should be sponsored completely by the government and free for all children under 15 years to visit.,4,150268435,Great place for Kids
3-Feb-13,"Scitech always fascinates the kids, they have many displays, everything is interactive, there is an area for the little kids that is a bit like 'Bob the Builder' and lots for them to do in there.

There was many walking around willing to help and show the kids how things work. That was great and very much appreciated it. Good day out!,5,154805909,Entertaining!
8-Apr-13,I was visiting Perth with my young family and a local friend recommended Scitech. I hadn't heard of it before so wasn't sure what to expect. Our 3 and 5 year old had a fantastic time exploring all the interactive displays in the huge open area inside. We only had a couple of hours to spare so did not get a chance to look at all of the exhibits but when we are next in Perth we will certainly be back!,4,156942632,Great place for kids of all ages!
9-Apr-13,"If you're local, buy a membership so you can take your kids regularly. Along with plenty of static displays (I never get sick of checking out the little chicks hatching) they regularly change the exhibits. Last time I was there, I took my 6 y.o. grandson on a weekday (it was a pupil free day at his school). We got there at around 9am and pretty much spent the rest of the day there - and I had to talk him in to leaving at around 3.30! I've been taking him there for some years now and will continue to do so as long as he wants to. They have puppet shows, the planetarium and science 'shows' throughout the day too.",5,157119155,A great day out for the kids.
9-Apr-13,"Scitech is the only place of its kind in Perth, which is the reason we take the kids there about once a year. But it is small and very crowded on busy days. If you can get a season pass (very reasonable cost) and take advantage of the special activities which you can book into, it is well worth it. Try very hard to go in off peak times if you want a pleasant experience, or else your kids will have a hard time getting on any popular exhibits, and many people let their badly behaved kids run around with no supervision while they sit in the table area and relax. No cafe inside is a huge downfall, just vending machines.",3,157132547,Too small and very crowded.
18-Apr-13,"This is a great location to take your curious kids to learn about science. There are lots of interactive experiences to be had. There's an area for eating and I noticed a number of parents had brought their lunches with them. Many mothers with babies appeared to be very comfortable. While you eat you can observe some scientists (behind the glass) going about their duties in a lab. My children were very excited. The only downer was the presentation about the brain. The young man presenting wasn't coping too well with his young audience and some of the activities were too advanced for these kids. Overall, we were glad we visited:)",4,158074894,Busy kid heaven

I almost had to run to keep up with my 7 year old as he zoomed from exhibit to exhibit. We also attended a hour long educational musical (included in the ticket price) which was a good chance to rest some tired legs.

But once inside we discovered so many interesting and fun exhibits that even my 60 year old father was playing away! Needless to say my three kids aged 5, 3 and even the 10 month old had so much fun hands-on trying the magic crystal ball, testing strength on pulleys, creating woodwork objects by hand. 4 hours were not enough to see and do everything!

I went to see 'We are all aliens' in the planetarium, which was very good, what I saw of it, but unfortunately I fell asleep during it - no reflection on the show itself, I just didn't get enough sleep the night before and the seat was far too comfy! I also went to 'Ignite your curiosity', a chemistry show in the science theatre - you will definitely not fall asleep during this! I walked around the 'Ingenious!' exhibitions, of which there were lots, but did not get to try any out as children were on all of them. I would go again, but only when children are in school. It was expensive enough at AUD17. I had a look through the discovery shop and it had lots of things. I didn't get any as I had to get a flight and did not want to carry more, but if you've space there is plenty of choice.",4,202813705,wish I'd gone outside of school holidays

Get there early for the science lab show and puppet show. I wasn't able to do the planetarium show because you need to be 4yrs old and older to get in. The staff was informative and so friendly. They even taught us how to do a few carnival tricks. I found myself telling the kids to hold on a minute while mommy finishes this...because it was even fun for me. They had something for all ages. The only negative I can think of is the hours need to be longer in the day. We spent 5 hrs there and even though we got to see/do everything, we wanted more time.

Be careful with parking as the inspectors underneath are really vigilant!,5,245525391,Young Einstein's
30-Dec-14,Probably not as enjoyable due to all the kids being out of school and it was a hot day. There was to many people to enjoy the Experiments. Only spent about 2 hours here ,3,246450299,Small and crowded

7-Jan-15,Thought it was very fun and engaging! Lots of kids around but also enjoyable for adults too. It was very busy when we went but still had a great time.,4,247886092,Very fun
9-Jan-15,We took my partner's daughter here during her time with us. Great hands on activities that seem educational too. My partner's daughter also loved the puppet show!,4,248412109,Great day out with my partner's 6 year old!

1-Feb-15,Brilliant venue and great value for Perth. Kids were really engaged. The 3D planetarium which teaches you about the solar system was wonderful and my kids want to go back again soon.,5,252058557,Scitech

10-Feb-15,Scitech was very interesting and fun for all. In the past you had to pay for Scitech and also for the Omni theatre show so we were stoked to see that the Omni theatre was a part of the entry to Scitech now so that was a bonus! Lots of kids running around everywhere but there was never a long wait to have a go at some imaginative or interesting hands on feature. And if there was...we just went around and came back to it. Lots of little quick and easy tests and interactive things to do...highly recommend it!,4,253516014,Fun to be had!
15-Feb-15,"Great activity centre for the young ones to learn more about science. Fun exhibitions and shows for toddlers too.

However, in quieter times it is absolutely fantastic. They kids have so much fun and they don't even realise that they are learning. A highlight is the Planetarium. Nearly renovated and very educational.",5,254759045,A place to avoid during the school holidays.

18-Feb-15,"If it's stinking hot outside, or pouring with rain, this is the place to hole up for a few hours. Scitech manages to entertain the youngest children, at the same time as offering fascinating new discoveries for the mature visitor. Whether you just enjoy browsing and pushing buttons, or participate more fully in the activities and presentations, there's something for everyone. Convenient for the centre of town, on the train line to Fremantle, and plenty of parking. Not cheap, but then what is in Perth?",5,254785212,The Excitement of Science
18-Feb-15,"Scitech is a great interactive place for kids of all ages from 3 to 93. There are permanent exhibits that demonstrate many scientific principles, themed featured exhibits that change every six months or so, live demonstrations, interactive shows for younger kids, a planetarium and a dedicated area for very young children. I have been to Scitech many times over the years, first with my own kids and now with my grandkids. The last time I went in Januray, I took my 5 year old grandson for his first ever visit. He was beside himself with delight. We happily spent 5 hours there and even then I almost had to drag him away. He now says he wants to be a scientist and work at Scitech.",5,254796337,Kid's Heaven

19-Feb-15,Good displays but aimed mainly at kids. 10 minutes walk from CBD but can get free Green Cat bus. Not exactly cheap.

9-Apr-15,"As the title suggests, don't go with high expectations, and you will be fine. I have visited several science museums, but this by far, for a major city, has to be one of the most disappointing. It's all one ONE floor, and can be all accomplished within 60 minutes, at a slow pace. The planetarium was very disappointing, as the show lasted 45 minutes and was more adult themed then kids orientated. So much so, that half the audience walked out, 20 minutes into the show. Food is expensive that's why the Pack lunch area was completely. Enjoy.",2,264595429,Don't go with high expectations!

13-Apr-15,We visited Scitech on a recent trip to Perth. I wasn't sure there would be enough to justify the cost for my 2 and 4 year old's but there was. They both loved it. There's a great under 7's area and many other exhibits were fun for them. Highly recommend.,5,265423387,Fun for kids of all ages
14-Apr-15,"Very popular (and thus very crowded) on any day that is very hot or wet. This is one of Perth's best indoor attractions and showcases the fun that can be had in science. The planetarium show should not be missed and other live science shows throughout the day will always be good to watch. This is affordable entertainment and if you are in Perth, and have children this is pretty much an essential part of their childhood experience.",5,265568881,Great fun
17-Apr-15,"Don't come to Scitech expecting anything like the Powerhouse Museum or it's ilk.

A favourite was the construction site and it was interesting to see how kids who had never met before all came together in a spirit of team work to ""build"" their project. The puppet show was extremely good and really engaged the little kids. The ""explosions"" show was more for older kids but also quite interesting. I have been to much better Planetariums though! It was mother's day so mom went in free which is always good:-). All in all I would call it an average experience.

7-Jun-15,This is great for visiting families. Very interactive but you need to pick your time. I took interested elderly friends who could not get a look in with all the kids that push in.

Older kids and adults can experiment, make things, see how things work and attend science shows or the planetarium. The special areas are always changing. Last time I went it was all about circus attractions, this time it was transport with planes to climb in and feel like flying and airships to manoeuvre.

5-Nov-15,"Took my two sons in school holidays, saw the Flight 3D movie which was mind-blowing (and their fave topic), then walked around most exhibits over three hours, till they were exhausted. Very high adrenalin place if you're into science, space, or just life. Scitech has done a superb job, easily competing with the Singapore science centre which we visited this year. ",5,324588571,This place is brilliant!!
12-Nov-15,Sci tech is located only about five minutes from the CBD. There is parking outside but if you go during the school holidays or their busier times you can always park at harbour town shopping centre and sci tech is only a five minute walk away.,4,326275644,Great fun for both kids and Adults
15-Nov-15,As an older couple with an interest in science we found Scitech very interesting. Sometimes you have to wait a short time while excited children have a go at the exhibits but it is worth it. We love to be around happy inquisitive children so it does not make a difference when we let them have their go first.,4,326819891,Not just for families with kids!
16-Nov-15,"I did not go to Scitech, they came to our child care centre. The team are young and very talented. The team were very good demonstrating experiments to the young children",5,327069806,Wow
17-Nov-15,Scitech is easily the best science museum my daughter and I have visited to date. He staff were incredibly helpful in explaining both how the interactive exhibit worked and the science behind it. My daughter danced with robots and rode a Segway! 3 hours very well spent,5,327299074,Would rate 6 if I could
20-Nov-15,"My daughter loves going to Scitech. There is a special toddlers area for younger kids, and so many hands on experiences for all ages. Friendly staff on hand, great puppet shows and demonstrations. Great for rainy or really hot days.",5,328033125,"Great fun place to explore, play and learn"
27-Nov-15,Great attraction for everyone to go and visit. Very hands on activities meaning you can let the kids run a little wild and not worry to much.,5,329277701,Fun for young and old and always something new.
27-Nov-15,It was packed ! lots for the kids to do. Maybe better when they are 9 years plus- mine wanted to scatter in all directions so it was hard to herd them along together. Next time Id take the kids who are more independent and just let them go for it! Its indoors and educational so great experience if kids.,3,329306102,Saturday at Scitech
30-Nov-15,One Day my Brother took me to Scitech because I had Holidays and I wanted some educational fun. EPIC,5,329810981,Nice Holidays
5-Dec-15,Took my 3 children there for the holidays. Their expectations were high especially after having been to the one in Melbourne. Somehow they were not too excited when they returned. ,3,330792721,Expected more
6-Dec-15,"We reach Scitech at 2pm, just in time to catch the last show of the day, inside the Planetarium. The other shows (inside the smaller theatre within) were all over. For this reason, you should reach earlier, perhaps 10am, in order to catch more shows. Plenty of scientific and construction stuff for the kids to play with. Nothing much for the parents to do while the kids have fun. The building have other stores where adults can spend time on. Remember to bring your parking ticket along as the Scitech can validate for you.",4,330983863,Lots of interesting things for kids to try out
11-Dec-15,Scitech is a great day out to spend with your family. Kids can also learn a lot with the number of interactive activities. The planetarium is a must.,5,331921739,Fantastic
11-Dec-15,"we have been visiting Scitech multiple times a year since the kids were toddlers - they are now 10 and 12 years old. There are multiple fascinating displays for all ages, and a good mix of temporary themed exhibits as well as the permanent ones. puppet shows for the littlest, stage demonstrations and the planetarium provide additional entertainment and information. We usually spend at least half a day here. Can be very crowded in the school holidays.",5,331933460,A favourite with the kids
14-Dec-15,"A science centre within the city, you can take the free CAT bus there. Interesting exhibits, engaging for kids. Indoors and aircon which is great for a raining day. There' also a Imax theatre included in the entrance fee.",4,332573952,science experience for kids
15-Dec-15,"If you have young kids, it's a great place to visit. I was there with my kids - 11 and 7 years old. My younger didn't want to leave after 5 hours. We parked the car at City West underground parking and got the ticket validated when we purchased the entrance tickets for free parking for the day. Do bring some snacks as places to eat are limited. In Scitech there are some vending machines for drinks and snacks with tables and chairs for you to have your snack. ",5,332767931,Worth while for a visit
15-Dec-15,"we have been here on a few occasions and its been a great favourite, loved by the very young to the quite old.",5,332790708,Fantastic outing for all ages
17-Dec-15,"Huge place with interactive experiences!!! Electronic, mechanical, water. lasers, mirrors, a 180 movie theatre with Morgan Freeman narration about stars. Excellent place to go with kids, teenagers and also adults. Schools can give a joyful afternoon to students in there!",4,333346437,"Very interesting, mostly interactive attractions!"
20-Dec-15,"Another fond memory from childhood field trips brought to life again as an adult. Worth visiting with children especially, but as an adult as well. Very fun and full of info!",5,333956045,Great science museum!
23-Dec-15,"This is a great day out, inexpensive and very informative for both children and adults alike. All very interactive so get involved and have fun. Take your own picnic and eat in the designated area right in the middle of the venue. The planetarium is situated in the same building with a NASA space travel event in the morning and a trip around our galaxy in the afternoon and is absolutely brilliant. 5 minutes from the city centre.",5,334495210,Fantastic
28-Dec-15,"Absolutely worth going here...Loved if. Such a relaxed atmosphere...So many things to do, read and participate in...They really have got this business running superb...The best science centre I've ever attended. Hands down beats Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney science centres...The entry price is sooooooo worth it...",5,335324573,Awesome
2-Jan-16,a lot of work and effort has been put into keeping kids engaged in the activities the staff are very friendly and really care about the place. the news space exhibition was on when I visited with my family and it was fab!!,5,336531259,great day out with the kids
3-Jan-16,"Amazing place, lots of things to keep kids busy. I actually learnt a few things too! The only down side was the lack of places to eat, we had to walk over to a neighbouring shopping precinct for food as the one small cafe that was open, had 1 member of staff, struggling to deal with everyone wanting food. Staff were all amazing and friendly, quite knowledgeable also.",4,336837090,Great place!!!
4-Jan-16,This place is not only educational but a fun day out for those of all ages! It combines learning with interactions and fun games for all to try.,5,337233538,Fun for all Ages!
6-Jan-16,"Well worth visiting, our 6 and 8 year old's loved it. $52 for a family ticket, lots of interactive/ educational things to see and do and the planetarium show (45 minutes) was excellent.",5,337703339,First class fun and learning
6-Jan-16,"A few minutes off the Perth City proper. Sits strategically on a carpark, the City West is also home to a furniture and appliance store outlet. My Son and Daughter came home disappointed, probably more disappointed than I was. If you hit this place in the early afternoon, the main attraction could be either or as times of events are simultaneous and far apart that you couldn't catch both on the same afternoon. More than due for an upgrade in attractions as lots and heaps are happening in space. Operators of the Scitech should be treated to Orlando, Florida for some Kennedy space centre adventure and they wont probably come home to Perth's Scitech.",1,337850794,Not worth the price and time
7-Jan-16,I have been here a few times and my little 5 year old girl loves it. It is very hands on in regard to playing with things and building stuff. The are shows to see and food and drink to purchase. There is lots of things to see and do and you could easily spend a whole afternoon here. Very educational and well run. Parking is free if you display your free pass obtained when you buy your ticket.,5,338012975,Really good for Everyone of all ages
7-Jan-16,"For science buffs from young to old this venue with its moving and hands on exhibits is worth a visit. If from out of town or overseas, a rainy day will brighten for you.",5,338045370,Superb
13-Jan-16,"This place is extraordinary beautiful for kids to enjoy and exploring, I always spend time with my daughter here. there are plenty of things for kids and they do it serious include science, play ground and so on",4,339521477,fun time with daughter
14-Jan-16,"So Good. great for all ages, even the adults. When we went they had the extra bit on Astronauts and what it takes to become one and what they go thru etc. The Planetarium which is included in the ticket was on Planets and they also had another show on Flying. The only down side I found was that there was no real cafe© inside, it was all vending machines and every thing was $2.50. You could bring your own food and drinks in but we didn't know that. There are 2 places to eat out side and you can come and go all day. So you could leave for lunch and come back in. There was also a Lecture on Maths and how it is related to science and every day. Lots of explosions. It really is good value for money if you want to spend the whole day there. It was busy but shows every half an hour took a crowd away for 30mins. You can buy tickets on line or there. There is parking there but only 2 hours free. You then have to pay. If you go early there is plenty of undercover parking. You could get there by bus or a walk from the train station.",5,339747654,So totally worth it.
15-Jan-16,Always a great experience. Make sure you go to the planetarium - interesting and well presented. The show depends on the topic - and if you have toddlers and there are explosions they will be scared. Rather take them to the puppet show.,5,340222531,Never disappoints
16-Jan-16,"Decided to go and check out for a day out, the planetarium is amazing! The host in their really knows what he is taking about and the short films are really well made - if I only went to that I would be giving 5 stars!",3,340379527,Only the Planetarium is worth it!
18-Jan-16,We took our 12 year old daughter and her friend to SciTech as part of a 'treat weekend'. The highlight has to be the Planetarium - the presenter is great. ,3,340833923,Planetarium - our highlight
18-Jan-16,"Great day had here can take your time looking around no rush, make sure you do have plenty of time especially for the kids to enjoy. There is a great planetarium where 2 different shows are shown during the day its like being in a 3d scene. Maths and explosions is a great show as well.",5,340874584,Great for all ages
29-Jan-16,Spent the best part of the day here with our two young granddaughters who thoroughly enjoyed every minute. Loads of interactive things for all ages and some perfect photo opportunities. ,5,343524604,You're never too old
31-Jan-16,"We go quite often as we live close by, our kids are young and they love the exhibits.",4,343896716,Great for kids 3-10
31-Jan-16,"Scitech always manages to find a way to entertain kids. The entry fee for a family is reasonable ($52) and the children will definitely remember the events. However, if you're on a tight budget then the beach or Kings Park may be better. ",4,343905432,Great Family Day Out
9-Feb-16,"Great way to spend a morning. While we were a group of adults only, we found plenty to do. The 3-D movie was awesome and the space display engaging and thoughtfully done. We skipped many of the hands-on activities designed for young children, but found plenty to challenge us in other areas.",5,345962002,Great for Families AND Adults!
9-Feb-16,Very educational and a great day out for kids. Probably wouldn't hold the attention of adults for too long on their own.,4,346019368,Great for curious kids
9-Feb-16,Go if you need a great weekend activity to exhaust the kids! I would definitely also invest in getting a voucher for this one so its cheaper to enter.,4,346034966,Great for kids
9-Feb-16,a huge variety of different things to do and interesting to ,4,346046302,a very interesting place
9-Feb-16,There is something here for all age groups. Very educational and lots of exhibits to get hands on with and be challenged. Children of all ages love the variety and the hands on aspect of Scitech. The adults can find plenty here to amuse themselves as well. I have been here a number of times and have always had lots of fun.,5,346213852,Fun for the whole family.
18-Feb-16,Came here thinking it might be like the Science Museum in London. How wrong was I.,2,348631175,Ok for kids
28-Feb-16,My kids always enjoy going to Scitech...and there are always new displays and heaps to learn. A must see if you are visiting Perth!,4,351445055,good fun for all of the family
5-Mar-16,Great facility and really enjoyed the entertainment. Lots of puzzles and interesting facts. I also enjoyed the demonstrations,4,353102382,Fun games
7-Mar-16,"Governments want to get students ""interested in science"" and Scitech is one way of encouraging this interest. Scitech has good exhibits and has interactive displays which interest young people. Adults are usually visit Scitech as ""add ons"" for their children. I find it interesting, and I'm not really interest in science. If you go to Scitech you may be just tagging along as company for your children.",4,353536209,Get interested in science
11-Mar-16,"A good place to keep kids amused for an afternoon. Very interactive and informative, lots for kids to do. Love the robot!",3,354438570,One for the kids

15-Mar-16,Scitech is a wonderful place for children to interact and have fun with science!,5,355469238,Excited Children!
17-Mar-16,"A great attraction for families with children and looking for something to do - a place where you can see how things work, get involved and have a wonderful time.",5,356261915,Great for  the curious
17-Mar-16,There is so much to do at this museum. It is a fantastic learning environment for children. Some parts are a little dated (the 3-7yr old area) but lots of the displays are fairly new. There is a baby change area/parents room and a picnic area. There isn't a cafe but they do allow you to exit and return. The cafe in the shopping centre was closed the day we went so we had to venture a little further. We had a great few hours spent at the museum.,4,356278775,Great for children. 
21-Mar-16,"Always loved Scitech as a kid, even now as an adult I still love it. Defiantly a place to visit and enjoy spending time with the family. It is also very educational as well as fun which is a bonus.",4,357194700,Great for the family
26-Mar-16,"Lots of hands-on exhibits to keep children engaged. The place is actually half the size of the Singapore Science Centre but holds as much fun. The presentations by the staff in the planetarium are very interesting and fun. Catching the different shows at different timings helped us pass 5 hours easily. The cafe downstairs serves simple food, not the most yummy but enough to fill us up. SciTech is 10mins walk from Watertown Outlet Mall where there are more food outlets but do look out for traffic as there is a busy intersection.",5,358626833,Hands-on fun for the family
30-Mar-16,This is well worth bringing the whole family to. So many things to do and experience you will all leave having learned at least one thing and having done so in a fun way. It's€™s great to have something so close to the city to do especially with kids and if the weather is not the best. Definitely put it on the 'to do' list.,5,360046363,Fantastic for all the family!
9-Apr-16,"I have visited Scitech on and off since the 80s and learned a couple of things along the way... Staff are motivated and enthusiastic, exhibits are ever-changing with some good staples, and shows are always engaging. The place caters well for various age groups and would also be fun for adults-only groups during a quiet time (I actually went to a 40th birthday there one evening). School groups can turn the place into a nightmare so pick your times to visit carefully (very early or late in the day is usually good). Saying that, school excursions are run well, with great activities planned for specific age groups. If you visit as a one-off, allow plenty of time to watch the science shows and visit the Planetarium, particularly if you have children above 8 years of age. Though small, Scitech compares quite well to other Science centres around the world. If you live in Perth, purchasing the yearly pass for the family can be great as you can pop in whenever you are near the city and just stay for short bursts (which is probably more beneficial from an educational perspective).If you park in the car park below, Scitech will cover the cost of your parking - just take your ticket to the desk and show them.",4,362641648,Pick your time to visit!
11-Apr-16,Scitech has things for all ages. It is a great contribution to the education of Perthians and their astronaut exhibit which they recently had was top notch. There is always hands on activities and knowledgeable staff. The planetarium is also amazing.,5,363218308,great experience
12-Apr-16,I really dislike these sort of pseudo educational demo dumb places where your kids get to turn loads of knobs on broken machines. That said this was a particularly impressive one. Not sure how much they actually learn flitting from installation to installation. What is the point of distorting mirrors for example. It's a human zoo and well worth staying away from if you are an adult. The kids enjoyed it though so that's the main thing.,2,363533992,"I hate these sort of ""educational"" places"
15-Apr-16,A great way to pass away a morning or afternoon in Perth. Fun and interesting place to visit for everyone in the family! ,4,364282577,Fun place to visit - for kids and adults!
19-Apr-16,"A great interactive science centre. Although there are regular changing exhibits and shows, its the old ones that seem to thrill my kids the most. Whenever we're in Perth, we spend a few hours, mainly in the Discoverland play area and attending a puppet show.",4,365368251,"Get an annual pass, it's better than a play centre!"
20-Apr-16,Went here with my au pair kids and they loved it. You can easily spend the whole day there. But after five hours on a busy day we were pretty tired.,4,365610130,Fun but busy!
21-Apr-16,Came here on a recommendation. Great afternoon with the kids enthralled - moans all around when it was closing time. Lots of interactive stuff to do and the astronauts section well worth spending a decent amount of time in.,5,365787458,A rainy afternoon well spent...

29-Apr-16,"This Scitech is very nice! We were scared that its just for children but adults can enjoy fun too! :-) Its informative, interesting and funny.

Find entrance to the Scitech is quite tricky because its hidden inside of shopping centre. :-) ",4,368608173,Its not just for children
5-May-16,"As a kid, we visited Scitech numerous times, so I was excited to go back after 15 years. Many of the activities have been around for years, but there is a lot of new things to do.

29-Jun-16,"Been here with my two teenagers on a weekday. Lots of small school children that they felt out of place. But after awhile, they pretty much enjoyed tinkering around.

But dragging as its a bit more than a hour but interesting just the same. Nice and amazing theatre. ",4,387209977,Interesting even for adults

23-Aug-16,"A pretty good place for a rainy day in Perth (not many of those!). Many things for kids to try and interact with, but in my opinion the Scitech main area leans too much towards play than learning or demonstrating any serious scientific principles. The Planetarium though is superb, some great shows and the narrators are great communicators. Still, I think it would be hard to find enough to do for longer than 2 hours. The entrance ticket is too expensive at $19 per adult - feels more like a $10-$12 attraction to me.",3,409065547,Strictly for kids

27-Sep-16,"It is good but not great, compare to Science World in Vancouver or somewhere like Epcot in Florida and you would be disappointed. A lot of the things are run down, missing bits or broken - lots of kids and not really enough to do - no massive play space or wow factor. The puppet show was a highlight and the guy doing was so brilliant / he was awesome. Cost wise is ok and easy to get to on train - all in all a good experience just needs some funds spent on and the need to regularly test each item of equipment.

Lots of great shows for everyone - Puppet show for the young ones, light show which is very interactive with the audience, Planetarium which was showing Dark Universe is very good and shows lots of information about the outer space and creation of the universe. Lots of friendly guides who are willing to help you with anything. There are also HEAPS of interactive experiments and interesting science that you never think of. Great hands on things. Lots of children come here so try come when there are less people otherwise it is very noisy and you don't get much time at the experiments.

As well as the hands on activities there's a planetarium, science theatre and puppet show-for smaller kids. There's also an area just for 3-7 year old's. There are vending machines to buy snacks and food in Scitech and we saw 2 cafes outside. But there is a 'eating' area in Scitech so we packed our lunch. You could easily spend half a day with older kids. Staff are super friendly and helpful at explaining exhibits. Only negative is that some of the exhibits could do with some extra information about how to use them. If you're driving ask staff to validate your parking ticket for 8 hours free parking. And if you're planning on visiting throughout the year its worth getting a yearly membership. ",5,434968292,Fantastic place to visit with kids

For me - I can go into the night sky observatory and learn from that script more and more every time. All staff are fresh and particularly helpful and knowledgeable. A great place to visit. There is a small 'sit down canteen area', to take a break. You can either purchase food or bring your own picnic.

He was underwhelmed by the show in the planetarium which was way above him. (Grandad's joke!). We had a great couple of hours but then we made the mistake of going to the puppet show. Seriously??!! It has nothing to do with science or technology and the script is pathetic. I felt sorry for the poor girl entrusted to do the job - we even had to get her from New Zealand! It was 85% boring chatter and almost nothing to do with puppets. The set was also pathetic. It relied solely on a talking tree. The climax was tame and the kids were bored. Surely Perth can do better than this? ",3,523721031,Is the puppet show for real??
13-Sep-17,"We thought we would spend a couple of hours here. Five and a half hours later I dragged my 7 and 8yo away! Admission is great value, including a great planetarium and an entertaining science show as well as five huge rooms of hands on science. Admittedly our whole family are science nuts but I think all families would find something to enjoy. The staff were young and enthusiastic and the place is so big it can absorb a lot of people without feeling crowded. Great day out.",5,523940040,Getting our geek on!
16-Sep-17,Being kids at heart we enjoyed the hands on activities - especially the robot cars but our favourite was the presentation in the Planetarium.,4,524747601,not just for kids
24-Sep-17,"It is possibly an ideal place to take little children or grandchildren, but unfortunately not much for young adults (high school or above). I was hoping for more displays, models, modern science rather than just games. I was in and out of the playground after 30 minutes, unlike my other visits to similar museums in NSW and ACT. Disappointing!",3,526995548,"A good venue for kids, but not for grown-ups"
1-Oct-17,Perhaps we will wait a few years until we bring our son back as I think Scitech is suited to 8 years and upwards but saying that our 5 year old had a great time but didn't understand the science behind it. I don't think a lot has changed since I was there as a child 25 years ago. Generally aimed at school children so a tad bit overpriced for adults I think.,3,528667652,Scitech with a 5 year old
3-Oct-17,Great place to spend a rainy afternoon and watch time fly by. Lots to do for all ages from toddlers to adults lots of fun learning to do. Would recommend seeing the different shows on offer ,5,529275088,Awesome family day out
5-Oct-17,"sufficient demo and workshops by Scitech. however, the timings are too close and would take up the whole day if you are interested in the hands on exhibits. There are loads of things to do for the kids between the age of 7 to 12 years of age. there is an area to have some snacks and drinks for the adults when the kids are engaged with the exhibits. there is also a very interactive puppet show. Parking was easy and entrance to Scitech will subsidise the parking. ",5,530069291,Experience at Scitech
6-Oct-17,Definitely worth a visit. Loved the planetarium and the Whodunnit exhibition was excellent. Kept my 10 year old daughter and friends entertained for hour . Great for the adults too thoroughly enjoyed our visit very educational ,5,530392091,Great 
10-Oct-17,"Located at Sutherland street, west Perth, the Scitech is a specialty museum with plenty of demos but the hands on activities/exercises take time . Open 930 to4 pm ,There is a lot to do for all age groups but especially for kids like puppet and science shows, planetarium, wonderland discovery shop, cafe. Admission is 19 dollars and 12dollars for kids over 4 years.",3,531684780,Scitech
20-Oct-17,What a day it was at Scitech! We went during school holidays so there were a lot of kids to compete with. Enjoyed the planetarium the best especially the shows narrated by Neil deGrasse Tyson. Also loved the Mindball game - it was pretty fun concentrating very hard to calm the brain's alpha and theta waves to levitate the ball.,5,534568058,A Day of Fun with Science
16-Nov-17,"The kids enjoyed this very much! They explored age-appropriate activities / exhibits / displays. The Planetarium was really really good. They have a puppet show, an interactive show for young kids. It's like watching the TV show High 5, live and with your kids as participants.",5,541278000,Impressive Applied Science!
23-Nov-17,great for a school holiday activity with primary aged children. Heaps of interactive displays and shows to watch,4,542740925,Scitech making science fun
1-Dec-17,We filled in a good 3 or 4 hours here with our 3 year old daughter. She had great fun playing with all the exhibits and trying all the different things. Favourite was the area where she got to build a wall out of foam bricks,4,544316284,great way to occupy kids for few hours
3-Dec-17,"We took some children earlier this year and they had a ball whiling away about four hours, we also enjoyed ourselves learning things along the way and knowing the children were in a safe environment so we could give them a bit more freedom to choose what they did and didn't do. Staff are fantastic.",4,544732200,Great for children
7-Dec-17,"This place is a lot of fun, only for kids. On one of Perth's rare rainy day, it's definitely worth checking out, passing time.",3,545551052,good for kids
18-Dec-17,"I visited with my sister, brother in law and nephew. It is debatable as to who enjoyed it most... We had an awesome time. It is educational and fun. ",5,547815421,Lovely Day out
22-Dec-17,Took the family to Scitech and couldn't get them out... they loved all aspects the displays the interactive activities and shows,4,548566432,Scitech

30-Dec-17,"On a short trip to Perth, this was the only attraction we went out of our way to ensure we spent some time at, it was highly recommended to us, and a worthwhile visit. ",4,550165641,Quick visit
2-Jan-18,"This is a fantastic interactive activity for the entire family, with the only exception being older teens. It is reasonably priced, educational, safe family fun. Parents can get actively involved or relax with a coffee. Can get busy at times, however, it all just seems to work.",5,550761587,Great Kid's Entertainment
3-Jan-18,"Science, Physics, Games and Planetarium all these you will LOVE. If you have children they will ask you to go there every weekend. One thing I do not like there-there is no a decent cafe nearby, especially on a weekend. Do no go there if you're hungry.",5,551156329,Scitech? It's crazily amazing!
4-Jan-18,"Having spent the day here with our grandchildren, who learnt, saw and touched so much science.",5,551324549,What a great set up
21-Jan-18,Make sure not to miss the planetarium show especially if you have your children with you. Quite interesting activities to do in the exhibition hall.,4,555155914,Children activity
29-Jan-18,Since our last visit 2 years ago the Scitech has invested extremely well in a number of new attractions. Our Granddaughters thoroughly enjoyed the light tubes and the moon buggy ride. They also still do the free car parking in the underground carpark.,5,557051928,Amazing improvements
15-Feb-18,"WOW - went here for date night part of Fringe Festival ! fantastic all round, service show everything so well done. I found that regular shows are done to entertain adults",5,560520805,Not Just 4 Kids

24-Feb-18,"Fantastic hands-on children's science centre and planetarium. There are science based activities for all ages that are really well done, and interesting for parents too! The staff are knowledgeable about the physics behind the ""experiments"" and are happy to give detailed kid-level explanations and even if that involves theoretical physics. We stayed until closing time, and still didn't see it all!",5,562443483,Just brilliant!
25-Feb-18,Great fun and great learning experience for the kids. Unfortunately a bit expensive to be coming all the time.,4,562604939,Kids love it
4-Mar-18,Scitech is the most amazing place to take the kids for a day trip. It has interactive exhibits that get the kids involved. I have taken my grandchildren there several time they range from 10-16 and they enjoyed the experience. It is within easy walking distance of the train station but does have parking available.,5,564150257,Excellent place for kids
5-Mar-18,"Our grandchildren love to go there. It is good to go early, when it is not quite so crowded. The staff are helpful and there is something for most ages. My granddaughter loved landing a spacecraft on a planet, driving a lunar buggy, making things and generally finding things out. ",4,564428406,Great place to take Children to learn some science.
26-Mar-18,"Really disappointing visit today. Came here about 5 years ago and all ages really enjoyed it from 11-16 year old's and adults so paid a total of almost $120 for 4 young adults and 2 seniors and felt like walking out after 10 minutes. There was a thing with a ball balancing on air - the ball was missing, a puzzle about number sequences and the numbers wouldn't stay on, the whole thing felt as if it was being run down. ",2,568825633,Big let down
2-Apr-18,So much to do to keep the kids engaged and not wanting to leave. The staff are very good at helping explain and help the kids ,4,570360940,Kids are in heaven

24-Apr-18,"After travelling to Perth multiple times in past 11yrs and always saying I wish we could go, we finally made it to SciTech at the end of last year. ",4,575290130,Amazing
5-May-18,We only had a couple of hours to fill in so it was a bit of a speedy trip through Scitech but definitely still worth it. When we visited there were only a handful of other families there so it was easy to get on to each exhibit. The staff were really friendly and pointed out how some of the exhibits worked. it really is a place you could spend hours in and there is something for everyone.,4,577976479,Educational and FUN!
