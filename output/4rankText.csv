"Get an annual pass, it's better than a play centre!"	"A great interactive science centre.

Great for curious kids	Very educational and a great day out for kids. Probably wouldn't hold the attention of adults for too long on their own.
Great Family Day Out	"Scitech always manages to find a way to entertain kids. The entry fee for a family is reasonable ($52) and the children will definitely remember the events. However, if you're on a tight budget then the beach or Kings Park may be better."
Great for kids 3-10	"We go quite often as we live close by, our kids are young and they love the exhibits.
The planetarium is probably for slightly older children as it gets very dark and the steps are quite high into the seating area, however the shows are..."

Popular (and busy) small museum.	"Don't come to Scitech expecting anything like the Powerhouse Museum or it's ilk. Museums in Perth tend to be small, slightly tired affairs (a result of poor State government funding to the Dept of Culture and Arts) and Scitech is no different.

kids loved it	"good place for the kids, something to do for all ages, with the money."
Good for young ones	"More for children than teens, but still great fun. Wouldn't spend more than a few hours there. Cafe is over priced. Exhibits are very interactive and fun."
Classic kid's weekend treat	"SciTech can usually keep kids occupied for a few hours. A couple of the science stations seemed to confuse the 6-8 year old set, but there's always the rock wall and train set to keep them happy."
Busy kid heaven	This is a great location to take your curious kids to learn about science. There are lots of interactive experiences to be had. There's an area for eating and I noticed a number of parents had brought their lunches with them. Many mothers with babies...
Great place for kids of all ages!	I was visiting Perth with my young family and a local friend recommended Scitech. I hadn’t heard of it before so wasn’t sure what to expect. Our 3 and 5 year old had a fantastic time exploring all the interactive displays in the huge open...
fun day out	"Took my 3 and a half year old, he loved it and would not leave, we ended up staying like 4 hours. Friendly staff!! I had fun too."
Lots to do	"If you have kids and half a day to waste, this is a great place. Go to website and check for show times though to coordinate a visit."
Great Fun for Kids	"Well worth a visit. Very interesting. The kids seem to love it. Always something different there. The cafe is a little expensive and ordinary, but most of the cafes in those sort of places are."
School Outing	"We went to the planetarium awesome and the dinosaurs in Scitech kids love it
We could have stayed longer but ran out of time."
great for the kids & parents	"Went to the Dinosaur exhibition with grandson, thought it was extremely well done. The overall things for the kids to see and play on is very educational and entertaining. Staff were extremely helpful in every way, even met us at the bottom of the escalatoer..."
Educational	Always a good trip with the children. The planetarium is popular and exhibits combine play and education.
Family fun.	Keeps the kids of all ages amused and entertained. Even on a very busy school holiday day no problem getting to touch and try everything out.
Good place for kids	On a rainy day this is one of the best places to be in Perth if you have children. Keeps them occupied for hours and there are interesting and fun science shows happening throughout the day. The place makes learning fun as it is fully...
Place for kids	"They have a ball....everything bangs, whizzes and pops. You can touch and manipulate everything. Nothing is out of bounds and most of it is noisy. This is kid heaven. Take them, you have too!"
Kids Heaven	Scitech is one of those places you go and the kids just don't know where to start - on top of that its educational and fun!
Kids Loved It	The kids (4-13) loved scitech. Was quite boring for the adults but was worth going for the kids. The Cafe is quite expensive though so take food and drink with you
Kids always love it.	"Kids always have a great time at Scitech. Plenty for all ages to do, truck loads of interactive stuff to do. Parking is easy..."
Great fun for children and adults alike!	There are many science interactive exhibits that both adults and children will like. A great learning tool for children at schools.
Plenty for the children to do	lots of different experiences for the children and parents a great place to go on the school holidays
hell yeah!	cant believe how much fun you can still have here as an adult. They do a fantastic job with the changing exhibits and the standard stuff (is that Handel's watermusic I hear?)
Sci Tec	A wonderful place to take children with so many educational exibits there and lots of hands on stutt
Good for kids	"My grandchildren and I had a lovely day at Sci-Tech.
The highlights were the talk on dry ice and the planetarium.
Suitable for kids of all ages but the cafe left much to be desired and is much too small and busy."
scitech is awesome	i like learning new stuff about science and i love science
Learn by Experience	"It is all that complicated science explained so simply through hands on experience. Displays are always changing so you can go again & again. Given every city seems to have a """"SciTech"", I'd recommend visitors to Perth to visit the unique sights of Perth rather..."
Variation Rules...	"Will never fail all ages as the exibits change....Food is an issue, either downstairs in the centre cafe or within the venue itself its limited. Best to do a morning and go elsewhere for lunch like stickey beakys at Kings Park."
Education centre	An educational experience for the whole family. Have fun while learning.
Fun for every generation!	"We have been visiting Scitech ever since we moved to Western Australia. Our son was then 17 and he enjoyed it. He's now 29 and still likes to go, but now we also take his young cousins, aged 10 and 12. We first took the..."
Educational!	"We went to Perth in early Dec 2008. At all our holiday destinations, we try to visit their Science Centres; so Perth was no exception.
SciTech DC was easy to find with our GPS in the rented car. It is part of a small shopping..."
Educational and FUN!	We only had a couple of hours to fill in so it was a bit of a speedy trip through Scitech but definitely still worth it. When we visited there were only a handful of other families there so it was easy to get on...
Amazing	"After travelling to Perth multiple times in past 11yrs and always saying I wish we could go, we finally made it to SciTech at the end of last year.
Not disappointed at all. Its nice to see the kids excited!"
Kids are in heaven	So much to do to keep the kids engaged and not wanting to leave. The staff are very good at helping explain and help the kids
Great place to take Children to learn some science.	"Our grandchildren love to go there. It is good to go early, when it is not quite so crowded. The staff are helpful and there is something for most ages. My granddaughter loved landing a spacecraft on a planet, driving a luna buggy, making things..."
Kids love it	Great fun and great learning experience for the kids. Unfortunately a bit expensive to be coming all the time.
