Scitech,"It was fun, the staff was friendly. Unfortunately, the puppet show was always full, we waited in line for 10 then suddenly it was full. Need more food in cafÃ¨.. good for kids, he was having so much fun with all the science stuff"
good for kids,"This place is a lot of fun, only for kids. On one of Perth's rare rainy day, it's definitely worth checking out, passing time."
Scitech,"Located at Sutherland street, west Perth, the Scitech is a specialty museum with plenty of demos but the hands on activities/exercises take time . Open 930 to4 pm ,There is a lot to do for all age groups but especially for kids like puppet and..."
Scitech with a 5 year old,Perhaps we will wait a few years until we bring our son back as I think Scitech is suited to 8 years and upwards but saying that our 5 year old had a great time but didn't understand the science behind it. I don't think...
Not bad - Good exhibits which arouse my son's interest!,"The place is on a smaller scale compared to Kulau Lumpur Petronsians or Singapore Science Centre, but it is still very educational and my son gets to play a lot of hands on exhibits! the bee hive is a very new thing to me!"
Great but avoid school holidays ,"My partner and I had a great time - very interactive, however if you wish to be more hands on avoid school holidays"
Distraction for young children only,"Not really a museum, just simplified and disappointingly dumbed-down ""science entertainment"" for young kids. About as much fun for an adult as a Wiggles concert. Bring earplugs."
Needs to be updated,"I have been to scitech multiple times like i am sure many other perth and surrounds inhabitants have been, and every time it gets a lot duller. even the first time no one in my friend group actually enjoyed the experience and the high price..."
Getting old and Dated,"It was the place to go many years ago, but its getting old and dated now. They just can't keep up without the funding and that is a shame. I think more needs to be invested into this icon of WA. It was the first..."
"Pretty good, lacks the wow of similar set ups worldwide ","It is good but not great, compare to Science World in Vancouver or somewhere like Epcot in Florida and you would be dissapointed. A lot of the thjngs are run down, missing bits or broken - lots of kids and not really enough to do..."
Better for younger children,Came here with children aged 14 & 9. While they enjoyed some of the activities they soon got bored. The planetarium however was brilliant for all ages. The theatre was aimed at the very young.
Strictly for kids,"A pretty good place for a rainy day in Perth (not many of those!). Many things for kids to try and interact with, but in my opinion the Scitech main area leans too much towards play than learning or demonstrating any serious scientific principles. The..."
Good School Holiday Day Out,We took my 2 year old daughter to the toddlerfest 2016 which seem to have a great time running around and playing with everything. The place just seemed a little dated and numerous attraction were out of order. Not a bad day out.
Very noisy,"Well, we have visited on few occasions and my view has not changed. It is good fun for the kids, no doubt about that, but as it's enclosed there is heaps of noise so you get sick of it pretty soon."
Crowded but fun,Great place to go but not so good if busy. Lots of interactive fun. Cafe area. Easy for kids to get distracted and lost.
Interesting but needs ipdate,"Went to Scitech with 6yo daughter and enjoyed it probably more than she did. Been a while since we had gone there but a lot of the exhibitions were the same.
Planetarium was interesting for older people - but probably too much talking and not..."
One for the kids,"A good place to keep kids amused for an afternoon. Very interactive and informative, lots for kids to do. Love the robot!"
Planetarium - our highlight,"We took our 12 year old daughter and her friend to SciTech as part of a 'treat weekend'. The highlight has to be the Planetarium - the presenter is great.
Unfortunately, we hit SciTech at what seemed to be the day out for all day..."
Only the Planetarium is worth it!,"Decided to go and check out for a day out, the planetarium is amazing! The host in their really knows what he is taking about and the short films are really well made - if I only went to that I would be giving 5..."
Not bad,"Great place to bring the kids for something to do
The dome cinema is worth a try as well
Fun and interesting"
Expected more,"Took my 3 children there for the holidays. Their expectations were high especially after having been to the one in Melbourne. Somehow they were not too excited when they returned.
Nevertheless I must say that for any first timers to any such similar attractions, it..."
Saturday at Scitech,It was packed ! lots for the kids to do. Maybe better when they are 9 years plus- mine wanted to scatter in all directions so it was hard to herd them along together. Next time Id take the kids who are more independent and...
Good Family Outing,"The kids had a lot of fun with all the hands-on science fun. A favourite was the construction site and it was interesting to see how kids who had never met before all came together in a spirit of team work to ""build"" their project...."
Family fun,"Took the children during school holidays to Scitech.
If you park undercover you take your parking ticket with you and you get 10 hours free once you pay your Scitech entry.
Kids enjoyed running from one side to the other testing and trying new innovative..."
For science fans,Good displays but aimed mainly at kids. 10 minutes walk from CBD but can get free Green Cat bus. Not exactly cheap. The planetarium is good but for some strange reason they refuse to post session times online. You have to phone and ask which...
"Great for young children, otherwise, pretty average","We have fond memories of Scitech taking our children there years ago. We had the opportunity to take our nephews there, and were disappointed. Scitech, when we visited, seemed to cater for the younger crowd (4-9 year old). Our youngest was 10 and he found..."
"Went during school holiday, maybe bad choice of day","We went with our 4 year old grandson, as we were in the area and the weather was not the best. Possibly a bad choice of day, as it was school holiday. If there were only preschool age children , it would have been far..."
Expensive for what it is Boring And Terrible Food,"Boring Activities For Kids Its Tired and needs New Fun Activities
The Food is Terrible Take your own Food and watch your kids as there are other kids that are under no supervision"
Worth a visit,"An interesting little location, one of which appears fairly packed with interesting items. On the particular time visited, the location was exceptionally busy and therefore we struggled to enjoy the location.
Prices were in my opinion too high for what it is, there isn't a..."
Lots of hands on activities,Scitech has a lot of hands on activities for a variety of ages. There are several different themed areas. I especially liked the movies shown in the theatre. The number of people was not overwhelming and when we had to wait in line for an...
"A good venue for kids, but not for grown-ups","It is possibly an ideal place to take little children or grandchildren, but unfortunately not much for young adults (high school or above). I was hoping for more displays, models, modern science rather than just games. I was in and out of the playground after..."
Is the puppet show for real??,"I took my 5 year old grandson there today for a treat. It really is a treat because it costs a lot of money to get in. Still, he loved it and ran excitedly from exhibit to exhibit. He was underwhelmed by the show in..."
School excursion,"Attended with year 2 children and teachers. We had a guide for some of the experience which helped group the kids and give them a basic understanding for those who hadn't attended before.
Children's love day exploring but was hard with a larger group. Some..."
Really only for kids,"Found the displays to be mostly very simple (as 23 y
o's). Was some construction/ redevelopment of areas when we went but definitely more for kids, and all the kids in there were having a blast. Not as great as I had hoped but wasnt..."
Fun place for young kids,"Scitech is a fun place for kids 3-10 to play and learn in a safe environment. Kids that live in Perth, like myself, have usually gone there at least ten times by the age of thirteen, so it gets a bit boring, but for kids..."
Not for adults with no kids,I came here with my partner. We don't have kids but thought we'd check it out. It's just child orientated and not a lot of fun for adults. I thought it may be educational but it was more of a play ground. Good to do...
Small and crowded,Probably not as enjoyable due to all the kids being out of school and it was a hot day. There was to many people to enjoy the Experiments. Only spent about 2 hours here
Indoor playground,"I was expecting a whole lot more, and it turns out to be a science-themed indoor playground. It would be more enjoyable if it was more spacious and more explanation available (not all parents are good in science; definitely not me :))
Also, they do..."
Staff the highlight,"I took my nearly 6 year old daughter to Scitech on the last day of her school holidays, most schools had already gone back so it was a reasonably quiet day there.
Having frequently visited Science Alive in New Zealand as a child, I was..."
Better for kids over 10years,"Hi
Loved the different science experiments. Unfortunately there was a school group and we couldn't see the puppet show. The aliens show at the auditorium was a waste of time. Recommend avoid wasting the one hour there and instead spend time on the gadgets."
Great for kids,This is a great place for kids to learn about science. Not very interesting for me as an adult. I have been to much better Science centers but the kids seemed to have a great time.
A bit dated but worth a half day visit,"We only went because they had the animatronic dinosaurs, I was very disappointed with them, a lot smaller than the literature depicts and presentation was a bit ordinary.
The whole place just lacked something for me it's like it would have been great 15 years..."
This could be so much better,"Love the concept of Scitech. I really do. And I've been there four or five times: twice independently with my sprogs and the other times for ""birthday"" parties with other sugared-up kids that would love nothing better than to twist knobs and blow things up...."
Definitely better for younger kids,"The kids in our family, ages 11 and 12, had a fun and interesting time for about an hour before boredom set in. It's high-quality, clean, and safe, and the planetarium shows are good, but it really is for kids 4-10, no higher."
Wish it was bigger.,"The Scitech people do a great job of making the most out of a relatively small space (with a planetarium, labs, hands-on experiments, displays...) but Perth is getting big enough now to need more. This place is very popular and centrally located, but it lacks..."
An OK attraction,"I think this is the typeof attraction that you either like a lot, or become bored with quite easily. For me, it didn't hold my interest for too long. Many cities throughout the world have a similar attraction. I have been to some others and..."
Too small and very crowded.,"SciTech is the only place of its kind in Perth, which is the reason we take the kids there about once a year. But it is small and very crowded on busy days. If you can get a season pass (very reasonable cost) and take..."
Educational and Interesting,Fun for the whole family - a sensory spectacle which will educate and entertain - wear comfortable shoes and clothes and get involved.
A bit small,"We went with 5 kids ranging from 2 to 11 years old. They had a lot of fun there. It was quite a small place comparing to many other science centre in other cities. And it was very crowded on the day we went. However,..."
Not as fun,"It was a lot more fun when I was a kid, now it's boring and old. Nothing exciting is there, kids running amock everywhere. No control its basically like a daycare centre without the supervision!"
Great for kids... then you go back as an adult,"I used to love this place as a kid, it seemed so big and full of wonder! Went back as an adult and it was actually rather small, nothing much had changed and i think it needs some new things to make it fresh and..."
Average,Interesting enough on the first visit - but not out of this world.
